# vim-js-indent
JavaScript indentation for VIM

This project just hosts the 'indent' part from the (excellent) [vim-javascript](https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript) plugin by [Darrick Wiebe (*pangloss*)](https://github.com/pangloss).

The `vim-javascript` plugin is not very actively maintained any more and it's lacking all the new JSX/ES6 language features. Most JS developers out there are switching to [yajs](https://github.com/othree/yajs.vim) or [vim-javascript-syntax](https://github.com/jelera/vim-javascript-syntax) but both of those, even tho they are inspired and/or forked from `vim-javascript`, lack the indentation that `vim-javascript` provided.

So here it goes, `vim-js-indent` providing just this piece of functionality.

Installation is straightforward, just clone it in your *~/.vim/bundle* or use any plugin manager out there, like [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), [neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim).
There is no need for any `make` or `build` steps, just plain clone will do the work.
