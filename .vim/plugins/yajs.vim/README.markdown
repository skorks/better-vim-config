YAJS: Yet Another JavaScript Syntax
===================================

Yet Another JavaScript Syntax file for Vim. Key differences:

* Use 'javascript' as group name's prefix, not 'javaScript' nor 'JavaScript'. Works great with [SyntaxComplete](https://github.com/vim-scripts/SyntaxComplete).
* Recognize Web API and DOM keywords. Keep increase.
* Works perfect with [javascript-libraries-syntax.vim](https://github.com/othree/javascript-libraries-syntax.vim)
* Remove old, unused syntax definitions.
* Support ES6 new syntax, ex: arrow function `=>`. 

### Differences from jelera/vim-javascript-syntax

I start a new project instead of send PR to jelera is because: jelera/vim-javascript-syntax is not so active. 
And I want to do lots of changes, including ES6 and other not confirmed standard support.
Also, one of my goal is produce 100% correct syntax.
But it hurt performance, so I prefer to create a new one instead of merge back.

### Installation

Use pathogen or vundle is recommended. Vundle:

    Plugin 'othree/yajs.vim'
