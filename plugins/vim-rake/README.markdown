# rake.vim

With rake.vim, you can use all those parts of [rails.vim][] that you wish you
could use on your other Ruby projects on anything with a `Rakefile`, including
`:A`, `:Elib` and friends, and of course `:Rake`.  It's great when paired with
[`gem open`][gem-browse] and `bundle open` and complemented nicely by
[bundler.vim][].

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-rake.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help rake`.

## FAQ

> I installed the plugin and started Vim.  Why don't any of the commands
> exist?

This plugin cares about the current file, not the current working
directory.  Edit a file from a Ruby library.

> I opened a new tab.  Why don't any of the commands exist?

This plugin cares about the current file, not the current working
directory.  Edit a file from a Ruby library.  You can use the `:T`
family of commands to open a new tab and edit a file at the same time.
